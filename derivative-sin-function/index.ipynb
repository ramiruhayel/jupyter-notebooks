    "# Derivatives of trigonometric functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to our exploration of derivatives. In my last article we looked at the physical intuition behind the derivative of a polynomial function — $f(x)=x^2-2$ and to close out our discussion we decided to expand our horizons and try our hand at working out the derivative of a trigonometric function.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Motivation*: Given a trigonometric function like $f(x)=sin(x)$ we’d like to be able to find it’s derivative. Let’s begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello limits, my old friend...\n",
    "Firstly, let’s revisit the idea behind the derivative of a function. Given a function $f(x)=sin(x)$ we'd like to know how the value of the output of the function $f(x)$ changes relative to a change in the value of the input to the function, in this case $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}\\equiv{\\frac{f(x+\\epsilon)-f(x)}{(x+\\epsilon)-x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we let the value of $\\epsilon$ tend to zero (which we denoted as: $\\epsilon\\rightarrow0$) and we reasoned about the value of the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}$. When doing this, what we're actually thinking about is called the *limit of the function $f(x)$*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0}\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}\\to?$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can find the value of the *limit* of our function, then we will have found a way to compute the *gradient* or *slope* of the function at any given point. This in fact is the derivative of the function and it's what we want to find for the function $f(x)=sin(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The limit of $f(x)=sin(x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So back to the quest at hand, let's find the limit of $f(x)=sin(x)$. We begin as we did above:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}&\\equiv{\\frac{f(x+\\epsilon)-f(x)}{(x+\\epsilon)-x}}\n",
    "    =\\frac{sin(x+\\epsilon)-sin(x)}{(x+\\epsilon)-x} \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\frac{sin(x+\\epsilon)-sin(x)}{\\epsilon}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'd like to know how this ratio, $\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}$, behaves as $\\epsilon$ tends to $0$, $\\epsilon\\to0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0}\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}\\equiv\n",
    "     \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0}\\frac{sin(x+\\epsilon)-sin(x)}{(x+\\epsilon)-x}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\epsilon$ gets closer and closer to $0$, the value of the numerator, $sin(x+\\epsilon)-sin(x)$ gets closer and closer to the value of the expression $sin(x)-sin(x)={0}$ and the value of the numerator approaches $x-x=0$. In effect, the value of their ratio approaches $\\frac{0}{0}=\\infty$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leaves us in a bit of a pickle; if the value of the limit $\\lim_{\\epsilon\\to0}\\frac{\\Delta{f(x)}}{\\Delta{x}}$ is supposed to give us the slope or gradient of our function $f(x)=sin(x)$, then what we have on our hands is expression for the slope of $f(x)=sin(x)$ that is saying that the function is infinitly steep at all values of $x$! Looking at a plot of $f(x)=sin(x)$ we can see that this is clearly not the case!"
